# `karako_http_socks5h_proxy`

gives your programs a way to use an upstream `SOCKS5h` server,  
including its built-in DNS resolution on remote. meaning your own machine's DNS/HOSTS will not be used.

you can use it with aria2c, yt-dlp, ffmpeg, wget, curl (although it has `SOCKS5h` support),  
native batch-files scripts with `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`. 

most programs will use HTTP1.1 `CONNECT`, and once the TCP tunnel established it supports any traffic  
that the `SOCKS5h` upstream server would support (HTTP, HTTPS, ...).  
you can set firefox and edge browsers to use it as HTTP proxy, and it works very well.

note: hostname is hard-coded by design to be `127.0.0.1`. both `SOCKS5h` upstream server and this program must run on same machine.

binaries provided, supports many OS and architectures.

still under development so many debug information..
